### A github pages website for my portfolio

I set about to create this website to use as a virtual portfolio of my professional skills, and to provide more material to potential employers interested in my past experience. To create this website, I set about the following process:
1. I found an online template online that I liked, sourced from [HTML5](https://html5up.net/astral)'s free templates.
2. I bought a [custom domain](https://marcellonovak.com) for myself from google domains for $12 a year (what a steal by the way)
3. I created the website to my liking, editing the background, about sections, icons, etc. until I was satisfied
4. I created accounts with both [Formspree](https://formspree.io) and [Zoho Mail](https://zoho.com) to add functionality to the contact page, using Formspree to send the emails and Zoho to receive them in a business inbox
5. I added DNS records through zoho to create a business email: contact@marcellonovak.com
6. I (will add) my work in the work page, creating small seperate pages to explain each project, and created a small biography in my about page to flesh out my resume with personal information helpful to recruiters looking to get to know me.

I hope someone else trying to create their own professional portfolio site finds this page. For the low price of $12 a year, you too can create an impressive online repository for employers and increase your chances of getting hired.
