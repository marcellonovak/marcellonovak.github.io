                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            For my senior capstone at Embry-Riddle, our team collaborated with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 
                            to evaluate the feasibility of deploying Generative AI on spacecraft. We developed an autonomous 
                            Large Language Model (LLM) system optimized for a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC, focusing on offline 
                            image analysis and decision-making. This project pushed the boundaries of Edge AI, testing whether 
                            high-level reasoning can survive the extreme resource constraints of deep space.

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            Deep space missions face a "data bottleneck": high-resolution sensors generate massive amounts of data, 
                            but communication bandwidth back to Earth is extremely limited. By moving AI processing to the 
                            "edge" (AKA directly onto the spacecraft), we can enable future opportunities like real-time data filtering, 
                            autonomous navigation, and astronaut support. Our mission was to build a rigorous testbench on a 
                            Snapdragon architecture to prove that these models can run reliably without any internet or cloud connectivity.

                                Developed and profiled the model for the Snapdragon ARM CPU, 
                                with stretch goals for GPU/DSP acceleration.

                                Implemented quantization (4-bit/8-bit) and pruning techniques to 
                                compress the model into a strict 6GB RAM footprint.

                                Engineered a JSON-based I/O system to ensure the model's outputs were 
                                structured for autonomous integration with other spacecraft systems.
