                            Reported under two senior traders at Capula, a British hedge fund, to create custom tools
                            for bonds traders to quickly analyze risk, utilizing an inhouse API, Python, and a GUI.

                            Over the summer of 2023, I was given the opportunity to work abroad in London, England,
                            developing some software tools for a hedge fund. I was directly working under two senior
                            traders at the fund, who wanted streamlined tools for analyzing risk in their bond trading.
                            Normally they did this all through excel, but that was time-consuming, and they wanted a
                            more elegant, robust, and streamlined solution.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indented">
                            Before I had arrived, the in-house software development team had created a prototype for an
                            API to pull the firm's financial data for usage. I was given the data, a rough sketch, and
                            a desk. After asking further questions about what was desired, and sketching a few more
                            ideas, I had a blurry idea of what I wanted to create, and set about doing so.
                        </p>

                    <!-- Details -->

                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p class="indented">
                            Unfortunately, since the tools used confidential company data, I cannot provide the code
                            or authentic data used. However, I can provide a general overview of what I created.

                            The desired features were included being able to create intuitive custom configs for each
                            user, to be able to see several currencies/risk buckets/times in nested tabs, to be able
                            to combine any of the above in custom created tabs, to be able to select a group of cells
                            to get the sum value, and others. I was able to create a 3-fold nested GUI using tkinter,
                            and a simplistic yet robust config style with JSON.
