                        <p class="indented">
                            At the end of last year, I joined a Meteorology Research Team at Embry Riddle, where I
                            was tasked with fetching, parsing, and processing 3 years worth of GRIB2 data. This
                            processed data would then be fed into a machine learning model to predict the onset of
                            thunderstorms. Arizona has a yearly monsoon season, and thunderstorms have the
                            highest rainfall rates of the year, so this research would help to mitigate the damages
                            from flooding, hail, etc.

                    <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            This research project was broken down into two major tasks:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="custom-list">
                            <li>Downloading all the data from API calls</li>
                            <li>Converting all the data into a time-series CSV for each point</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="indented">
                            The API calls were rather simple to tackle, I created a program to make a call for each
                            hour from a start time, and then iterate a datetime variable until an end time was reached.
                            The API documentation was tricky to understand, especially the regex passed to it, but with
                            some tinkering I was able to download the data in roughly 20 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indented">
                            The time series conversion on the other hand was more challenging. The data was in grib2
                            format, and the task was to create a time series CSV for each point in the grid with
                            columns for each variable, and a row for each timestamp. Mind you, there was over 100,000
                            points in the grid, with over 100 variable "layers", and a file every hour for 3 years.
                            Safe to say optimization was the name of the game here.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indented">
                            Before I get into the optimizations I made, I'll explain the data processing pipeline.
                            You can think of GRIB2 files as a stack of papers, with each paper being a variable layer.
                            The whole stack covers the same geographic area, but the papers in the stack contain different
                            variables. On top of this, there can be multiple levels for those variables, such as
                            temperature at 750/800/1000K.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indented">
                            Ok TODO: create an image of the whole conversion bit of the x y z nonsense and explain it
                        </p>
